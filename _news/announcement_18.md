I will be organizing with Lisa Ehrlinger, Felix Naumann, and Ihab Ilyas the 12th International Workshop on Quality in Databases(QDB) at VLDB 2023, August 28, 2023, Vancouver, Canada. 

Data quality has been a major concern of organizations for decades. The recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought data quality (DQ) back into the spotlight: while many recent data quality and cleaning solutions are powered by ML, DQ is a core requirement to ensure reliable AI-based systems. DQ is tackled from different perspectives by different research communities, including database, machine learning (ML), and information systems. We believe it is important to bring together these communities to foster a vital discussion about the future of DQ assessment and improvement.

QDB'23 revives the successful QDB workshop series to cover the needs of the AI era, addressing both industry and academia (cf. data-centric AI). The workshop aims to (1) revive vital discussions about data quality, and (2) specifically exchange novel ideas and best practices about data quality assessment and improvement in the context of AI-based systems.
