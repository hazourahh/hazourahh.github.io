I am very much looking forward to chairing the 13th International Workshop on Quality in Databases (QDB24) at VLDB2024 together with Lisa Ehrlinger and Sourav S Bhowmick this Monday.

This year, we have put together a great program with 8 research paper presentations, a keynote by Sebastian Schelter on "How Data Management Research Helps to Improve Real World ML Applications", and a dedicated industry session aimed at fostering the interaction between academia and industry on data quality. 

The industry session consists of 2 experience talks by Quanqing Xu (OceanBase) and Divesh Srivastava (AT&T) followed by a panel between the two speakers and Fatma Ozcan (Google) to discuss current data quality challenges in industry and whether academia is addressing them.

See program details on our <a href='https://lnkd.in/dSxniebd'> website</a> 

I look forward to many stimulating discussions about dataquality!
