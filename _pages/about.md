I am a member of the <a href='https://indelab.org/people/'> Intelligent Data Engineering Lab</a> at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands. My research focus is on the field of data quality for and with machine learning.

Before that, I was a Postdoc at the <a href='https://hpi.de/naumann/home.html'>Information Systems Group</a> at the Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam. During my doctoral research at the same group, I worked in the field of data profiling with the aim of developing algorithms for efficiently processing and analyzing large volumes of data.

Beyond my research, I am also interested in keeping up with the latest developments in machine learning, data management, and integration. I am also constantly looking for new collaboration opportunities!
Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, reading, cooking and training.

## Research interests
- Data quality for AI (fairness, non-discrimination, privacy)
- Data profiling, integration and cleaning
- Data mining and machine learning
- Similarity search
